#====================================
# 1) URL rewrites
#   - Reference: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html
#   - Direct file routes ran through Apache as normal 
#       ~ For example, a logo at "/images/logo.png" doesn't need special handling, so use it as-is.
#   - All other requests get routed to a centralized file 
#       ~ "!-f" means "not a file that exists in app"
#   - The rewrite rule is a regular expression for any number of characters going to index.php.
#       ~ QSA causes the original request query string to be retained 
#           > Example: If request was "/members?chapter=123", the route turns into "index.php?chapter=123").
#       ~ L designates this as the last rule to check against.
